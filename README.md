# CES 2026 Exhibitor Scraper

A high-performance web scraper written in Rust to collect exhibitor data from CES 2026 (Consumer Electronics Show). This tool fetches comprehensive exhibitor information including company details, booth locations, product categories, and funding information.

## Features

- **Fast API-based scraping**: Uses the official CES exhibitor API for bulk data retrieval
- **Concurrent detail fetching**: Parallel requests with configurable concurrency (30 simultaneous requests)
- **Comprehensive data extraction**: Collects 15+ fields per exhibitor
- **Dual output formats**: Exports to both JSON and CSV
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time progress bars with ETA
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in delays to respect server resources
- **Deduplication**: Automatic removal of duplicate exhibitors

## Data Fields Collected

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Company/exhibitor name |
| `exhid` | Unique exhibitor ID |
| `detail_url` | Link to exhibitor detail page |
| `booth_venue` | Venue location (LVCC, Venetian, etc.) |
| `booth_number` | Booth number |
| `booth_full` | Complete booth location string |
| `description` | Company description |
| `website` | Company website URL |
| `address` | Full company address |
| `product_categories` | Product categories (semicolon-separated) |
| `hall_ids` | Hall location IDs |
| `seek_funding` | Whether seeking investment |
| `funding_amount` | Funding amount sought |
| `revenue` | Company revenue range |
| `investment_stage` | Current investment stage |
| `scraped_at` | Timestamp of data collection |

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- Internet connection

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ces_2026_rust_scraper.git
cd ces_2026_rust_scraper
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

Run the scraper:
```bash
cargo run --release
```

The scraper operates in two phases:
1. **Phase 1**: Fetches exhibitor list via API pagination (100 exhibitors per request)
2. **Phase 2**: Enriches data by scraping individual exhibitor detail pages

Output files are saved to the `output/` directory:
- `all_exhibitors.json` - Full JSON export with metadata
- `all_exhibitors.csv` - CSV export for spreadsheet use

## Example Output

```

## Dependencies

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `tokio` | Async runtime |
| `reqwest` | HTTP client |
| `scraper` | HTML parsing |
| `serde` / `serde_json` | JSON serialization |
| `csv` | CSV export |
| `futures` | Async utilities |
| `indicatif` | Progress bars |
| `chrono` | Timestamps |
| `anyhow` | Error handling |
| `regex` | Pattern matching |

## Configuration

Key constants in `src/main.rs`:

```rust
const API_URL: &str = "https://exhibitors.ces.tech/8_0/ajax/remote-proxy.cfm";
const PAGE_SIZE: usize = 100;  // Exhibitors per API request
```

Concurrency is controlled by a semaphore (default: 30 concurrent requests):
```rust
let semaphore = std::sync::Arc::new(tokio::sync::Semaphore::new(30));
```

## Performance

- **API Phase**: ~45 seconds for 4500 exhibitors
- **Detail Phase**: ~2-3 minutes with 30 concurrent requests
- **Total runtime**: ~3-4 minutes for complete scrape
